# The Anatomy of a Kubernetes Manifest

Every Kubernetes resource is defined using a YAML manifest with four required top-level fields:

```YAML
apiVersion: v1          # Which API version to use
kind: Pod               # What type of resource
metadata:               # Name, labels, namespace
  name: my-pod
  labels:
    app: my-app
spec:                   # The actual specification (what you want)
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80
```

- `apiVersion` — tells Kubernetes which API group to use. For Pods, it is `v1`.
- `kind` — the resource type. Today it is `Pod`. Later you will use `Deployment`, `Service`, etc.
- `metadata` — the identity of your resource. `name` is required. `labels` are key-value pairs used for organization and selection.
- `spec` — the desired state. For a Pod, this means which containers to run, which images, which ports, etc.
