## Understanding DevOps and Cloud Engineering
- What is your understanding of DevOps and Cloud Engineering?

DevOps is a set of practices and a culture that focuses on collaboration between development and operations teams to deliver software faster, more reliably, and with greater automation. It emphasizes CI/CD, infrastructure as code, monitoring, and continuous improvement.

Cloud Engineering focuses on designing, deploying, and managing scalable, secure, and cost-effective infrastructure using cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or GCP. It involves compute, networking, storage, security, and high availability.

Together, DevOps and Cloud Engineering enable automated, scalable, and reliable software delivery in modern cloud environments.
